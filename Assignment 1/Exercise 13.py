# Calculate the distance traveled down the interstate using the
# formula Distance = Speed x Time. A car is traveling at 60 miles
# per hour and your program should calculate how far the car traveled
# in the following times:
# Time 1: 7 hours
# Time 2: 12 hours
# Time 3: 16 hours

speed = 60
time1 = 7
time2 = 12
time3 = 16

distance1 = speed * time1
distance2 = speed * time2
distance3 = speed * time3

print(f"Driving at 60mph, a car will travel {distance1} miles in 7 hours.")

print(f"Driving at 60mph, a car will travel {distance3} miles in 16 hours.")
