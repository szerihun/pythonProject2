# (Short answer response) Write out in text a description of what
# the following program will display.
# myValue = 74
# myValue = 66
# print(myValue)

# Initially the variable myValue is assigned the integer value of 74.
# The variable is declared again using the same variable name of
# myValue. The new value will over-write the 74 and the interpreter
# will print 66.
